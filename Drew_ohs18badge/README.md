### Description
OSH Park will be producing electronic conference badges for the [2018 Open Hardware Summit](http://2018.oshwa.org/) on September 27th at MIT

The current concept is to have:
* ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth
* E-Paper to display the badge wearer's name
* Use wireless communication (WiFi or BLE) to allow badge wearer to update the displayed text from an Android or iOS phone

Quantity 300 badges are required for OHS 2018 on September 27th.

Maximum total budget per badge is: $25
(that will have to include components, batteries, PCB, assembly, lanyard, packaging)

Production plan:
The badge circuit boards will be pick-n-place assembled by a professional assembly service. A test jig will need to be created for the assembler to test the badges.

Production deadline:
September 1st, 2018
