# Getting started with nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle

## Introduction

This guide details how to get started with the nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle development, and what to expect when you do so.

When you get a new dongle, it has been preprogrammed with the OpenThread NCP image. So you can easily set up a Thread NCP Joiner, which can be securely authenticated and commissioned onto a Thread network.

## What you'll need

* nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle
* PC running a Linux based operating system or MacOS
* wpantund

## Installing wpantund

[wpantund](https://github.com/openthread/wpantund) is a user-space network interface driver/daemon that provides a native IPv6 network interface to a low-power wireless Network Co-Processor (NCP). It was written and developed by Nest Labs to make supporting Thread connectivity on Unix-like operating systems more straightforward.

**wpantund** is designed to marshall all access to the NCP, ensuring that it always remains in a consistent and well-defined state.

Follow the [wpantund Installation Guide](https://github.com/openthread/wpantund/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to install wpantund on Ubuntu or macOS.

## Connecting the USB Dongle

Connect the nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle to your host as shown below: 

![](images/connecting-dongle.jpg)

The USB Dongle will be recognized as an nRF52840 OpenThread Device like this:

![](images/nrf52840-openthread-device-info.png)

## Configure wpantund

In the NCP design, use `wpantund` to communicate with and manage the Thread device.

In a terminal window, start `wpantund` on the serial port with the NCP, creating the interface `utun7` and enabling info logs:

``` sh
$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/wpantund -o Config:NCP:SocketPath /dev/cu.usbmodem14112  \
        -o Config:TUN:InterfaceName utun7 \
        -o Daemon:SyslogMask " -info"
```

!!! tip
	To configure wpantund without using command line parameters, modify the `/etc/wpantund.conf` file.

If the NCP is successfully running OpenThread, the output should be similar to the below:

``` sh
Sep 11 20:51:21  wpantund[39634] <Notice>: Starting wpantund 0.08.00d (Jun  9 2018 00:31:51) . . .

Sep 11 20:51:21  wpantund[39634] <Notice>: Finished initializing NCP
```

Leave this terminal window open so that logs from wpantund can be viewed.

A user-defined interface is required to communicate with the NCP using `wpanctl`. Open a new terminal window and using `wpanctl`, connect to the interface you just set up:

``` sh
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/wpanctl -I utun7
wpanctl:utun7>
```

## Verify NCP

Verify that the NCP is in the correct state:

``` sh
wpanctl:utun7> status
utun7 => [
	"NCP:State" => "offline"
	"Daemon:Enabled" => true
	"NCP:Version" => "OPENTHREAD/20170716-00745-g79e35c57; NRF52840; Jul 15 2018 09:52:08"
	"Daemon:Version" => "0.08.00d (0.07.01-217-g86d29d6; Jun  9 2018 00:31:51)"
	"Config:NCP:DriverName" => "spinel"
	"NCP:HardwareAddress" => [38D6B665CE553B4F]
]
```

Now, you can scan for networks on the NCP Joiner. If you have formed a Thread network, the output should be similar to the below:

    You can follow this guide to [Build a Thread network with nRF52840-MDK](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-mdk/openthread/) for testing.


## Update NCP firmware

More features will be added to the NCP firmware gradually over time. The latest pre-built NCP firmware is a `.hex` file. You can download here:

<a href="https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/tree/master/firmware/openthread/ncp"><button data-md-color-primary="marsala">NCP firmware</button></a>

While holding the dongle's RESET/USR button, connect it to your computer. When the Dongle has entered the bootloader mode, the RGB LED pulses RED. It is now ready for programming.

!!! note 
	For programming, just follow the "[Programming](../programming/)" section.

## How to build NCP firmware?

You can also build the latest NCP firmware by yourself. The following steps detail how to do that.

1. Clone and install OpenThread:

	``` sh
	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/openthread/openthread.git
	$ cd openthread
	$ ./bootstrap
	```

2. Build the firmware with the following commands:

	``` sh
	$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 clean
	$ make -f examples/Makefile-nrf52840 USB=1 BOOTLOADER=1 BORDER_AGENT=1 BORDER_ROUTER=1 COMMISSIONER=1 JOINER=1 UDP_PROXY=1 CFLAGS+=-UCONFIG_GPIO_AS_PINRESET
	```

	!!! warning
		You MUST undefine the `CONFIG_GPIO_AS_PINRESET` flag, or the Dongle would not enter the bootloader mode next time by holding the dongle's RESET/USR button. 

		Please remember to add `CFLAGS+=-UCONFIG_GPIO_AS_PINRESET` to undefine the `CONFIG_GPIO_AS_PINRESET` flag!

3. Navigate to the directory with the OpenThread FTD NCP binary, and convert it to hex format:

	``` sh
	$ cd ~/openthread/output/nrf52840/bin
	$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex ot-ncp-ftd ot-ncp-ftd.hex
	```

	The `ot-ncp-ftd.hex` file is the expected NCP firmware.
